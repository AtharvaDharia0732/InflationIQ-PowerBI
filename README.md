# Inflation and Expenditure Project- SQL and PowerBI

<h1>Project Title: Inflation and Expenditure: Decoding Consumer Spending with Data Analytics </h1> 

<h2>Project Description</h2>

As the lead analyst for the "InflationIQ: Navigating CPI Shifts" project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of consumer spending patterns, inflation changes, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) across a diverse range of expenditure categories. This project involved a meticulous examination of economic data and trends, aiming to provide valuable insights for decision-makers in finance, marketing, and economics.

Here is the report with all the findings: [InflationIQ Report.pdf](https://github.com/AtharvaDharia0732/InflationIQ-PowerBI/blob/ed420acb8ec08108c5dc0c9e50e6ced96d9f63b9/InflationIQ%20Report.pdf)

<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
<ul>

<li>Data cleaning and preliminary analysis in order to get the basic understanding of dataset that covered multiple categories</li>
<li>Developed and designed interactive dashboards with the help of Power-BI and for communicating the underlying the trends and complex findings</li>
<li>Project involved investigating cause-and-effect relationships among financial accessibility factors within various expenditure categories in the USA region. By delving into these relationships, I aimed to provide valuable insights that could inform decision-makers.</li>
<li>Data visualization for easily digestible insights. The visualizations made the data more accessible but also enhanced the project's ability to communicate findings effectively.</li>
